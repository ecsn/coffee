Please note that this is research code. It is not very clean, and not well documented.

### folders

* datas -> type = dict : set of entity schema (extracted from DBpedia)
* output -> type = list (pickle) : list of attributes selected by coffee (output from CoFFee_pipeline.ipynb)
* schema_reference -> type = csv : attribute mapping between infobox and entity schema (used in experiment 2)

### source code:

* CoFFee_pipeline.ipynb -> main pipeline
